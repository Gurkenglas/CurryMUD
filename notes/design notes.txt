GOALS:

Create a safe environment where people have freedom to engage in identity exploration. This is the bottom line that ultimately should drive all aspects of world building.

Make it easy to create a new character, easy to experiment, and easy to restart after having made mistakes.

Give players choice; give them the freedom to try anything. Let them forge their own paths. This promotes immersion.

Avoid designing repetitive tasks that can be automated client-side.

Do not launch with insufficient content.

==========

COMMUNITY:

Help PCs foster relationships with each other and build communities. Religions, guilds, clans...
Shared knowledge, goals, projects, and pressures.
Shared history and future.
Shared property.
Shared "bank accounts."
Shared iconography.
Communication channels private to communities.
Archives.

Community participation should be entirely voluntary. Some players will prefer to remain independent.

Create dependencies between communities (these usually concern resources/economics).

Do not encourage xenophobia or prejudice (it could undermine community).

==========

SKILLS:

"Warning: don't have skills or attributes that affect how quickly characters learn skills. If you do, players will max them out at the first opportunity." p.367

If a character's crafting skill increases on the basis of use, then players are likely to create many items solely so that their crafting skill will rise, leading to a severe over-production of goods. p.565
Award experience points to crafters when someone buys their goods. p.368

Players who want to craft items must pay dues to a merchants guild. By paying dues, they gain access to the raw materials needed to construct items. The items that a character can craft depend on the character's skills.

Ideally, the same skill system will be applicable for all conceivable skills (crafting, weapon use, spells, etc.).

The skills you implement, and the complexity you assign to each "skill tree," sends a message to players regarding what is most important in your world.

If a skill is considered by nearly all players to be essential, then all characters should be given it automatically. p.362

Players must seek out "trainer" NPCs to learn and improve skills. Most trainers can be found in "schools."
Training should cost money.

Skill learning is an ideal candidate for an activity that players can opt to have their characters undertake while they are offline. (Travel is another.) p.450

==========

PD:

"If fleeing is not unlikely to succeed and the player base is too small to support gang warfare, an unmoderated world can thrive, and with the vibrancy that's hard to match elsewhere." p.418

"Virtual worlds are about identity; if you can't lose something, you don't value it; therefore, you can never value your identity in a non-PD world as much as you can in a PD world." p.433

Without PD, the people who are first to positions of power get to keep them.

Without PD, players who stick to the same character will essentially only be able to consume the same content once (or at least from only one angle).

"Keep the incidence of PD low and the awareness of its possibility high." p.424
The actual risk of PD should be generally lower than players estimated to be. It should be "favorably unrealistic."

When a PC dies at the hands of a mobile, the mobile should loot the corpse of all valuable items. p.429

Consider allowing players to appeal to have their character resurrected when they were unable to flee due to lag, bugs, or they were unjustly killed by another PC.
Would it be possible for the server to accurately track client latency during combat?

==========

MISC:

Allow some degree of player-created content, but only using in-context methods (which is to say that players cannot be "builders"). p.457-8

(Returning) players should be able to opt out of all tutorials.

Make ASCII art maps available in game. New players should start with a map, along with a short welcome letter (obtainable in the tutorial). Other maps may be available for purchase.

Give players badges for achievements.

Have an in-game newspaper. There should be a way for players to read old newspapers. The newspaper could be produced automatically (as opposed to being written by players).

Have in-game mail and BBS. Have a special BBS dedicated to OOC topics.

Make a library or similar area where players may read, for example, the history and backstory of the virtual world.
A museum-like facility could fill this role. There could be a statue for each race and god, along with a description on a placard. Refer to the Pantheon in "City Sites."

Implement a system for auctioning items.

Intoxicants affect speech, etc.

Make cigars and tobacco pipes.

PCs may have pets. Make pet shops where pets are sold.

Implement, in moderation, "environmental" affects, such as making PCs involuntarily sneeze when in a dusty room.

Devotees with the necessary skills may produce holy symbols; holy symbols are readily made available for free at places of worship.

Corpses that are not sacrificed may be "claimed" by Murgorhd. These corpses transform into zombies.

Make a "newbie donation pit" (possibly in a temple).

Consider running the MUD server on a minimal installation of Fedora.
You can get a good server of most Linux flavors for $5.00 a month at "digitalocean.com".

==========

COMMANDS:

Encourage players to create aliases (using their MUD clients) for emotes unique to their characters. This will give their characters personality and make them more vibrant.

"punch", "kick", and "headbutt" to attack without formally entering combat (though a NPC targeted with these commands may initiate combat automatically).

Make a command to get help on known powers/skills.

==========

GEOGRAPHY:

Where the map ends, consider creating insurmountable physical boundaries. p.275

The size of the virtual world should be proportionate to the number of players. A rule of thumb is to aim for 40 rooms per player. 20 rooms per player is crowded, while 60 rooms per player is sparse. The actual number of rooms need not coincide with the perceived size of the virtual world.
20 players * 60 rooms = 1,200 rooms

Provide both verbose and brief descriptions of rooms.

Have at least one area where PCs can fight each other essentially to the death, but instead of actually dying, a defeated player character will instead "surrender." Arenas.

Have special rooms where OOC communication is allowed.

When PCs enter a dark room from a light one, consider providing the description of the dark room after a few seconds delay, so as to model the time it takes for one's eyes to adjust. p.388

Make weather specific to zones. Weather must be appropriate for the given geography and terrain.

PCs may own property and residences. The construction of a house should take some time, so as to be realistic; however, if it takes too long, players will become impatient.

Make one or more cemeteries. If a PC's body is recovered and taken to a cemetery, it can be buried there, and a gravestone will be generated.

Provide special venues for storytelling.

Make a divine tree, shaped like a woman (similar to the one in HQ1).

Make a forest with gorhna nut trees outside Lop'len-ko. When the season is right, players can find trees with fruit. They will need to crack open the fruit to get to the nuts inside.

Make underground settlements, perhaps with secret/hidden entrances.

==========

ECONOMICS:

The more persistent the virtual world is, the greater the need for a formal economy.

Wealth enters the system. This happens when, for example, coin-carrying mobiles are generated, and when new characters are created.
PCs accumulate wealth when, for example, they mine for resources, and then sell them.
Wealth leaves the system when PCs buy items and services from NPCs.

Most virtual world economies are open. In an open system, what enters the system has no effect on what exits it.
(This is not the case in a closed system. In a closed system, as more and more PCs accumulate more and more wealth, the amount of money a PC receives for their deeds falls to compensate. Players will become inclined to hold on to their money until they really need it; thus the economy is headed for a grinding halt. Closed economies will always dry up eventually.)

In a fixed-price economy, the cost of commodities never changes. In such a system, inflation hurts everyone who crafts goods for which fixed-prices pertain.
In a free-market economy, prices fluctuate depending on supply and demand (and inflation, too). Most virtual worlds choose this model for their economy.

The free-market model certainly appears to be more maintainable than the fixed-price model. However, there has yet to be a successful large-scale implementation. It only works if ALL prices are variable. Mobile drops should be variable, too, along with the amount of money that new characters start with. Everything must accommodate for supply, demand, and inflation.

The trick is to give goods rather than cash as rewards. Goods get their value from the free market; therefore their value varies in keeping with supply and demand.

The virtual world is not the real world, however. Players may leave your virtual world, never to come back, when they become frustrated over the fluctuations of the free-market economy. Players are bound to get upset when they spend four hours collecting wolf pelts, only to find that wolf pelts are not nearly worth what they used to be. Virtual worlds must take into account the perceived fulfillment of their players, as players are free to quit a virtual world at any time.

Administrators and live teems may manually control and manipulate the economy, assuming that they really know what they're doing. They need to be ready to deal with accusations of bias and favoritism.

Have items wear out (realistically). This creates a money sink, thereby discouraging inflation. It also helps keep rare items rare.

Consider making certain services available for sale. This works especially well when the service is something that PCs can do for themselves, but players don't enjoy doing.

Consider not having banks, as they are out of place in a pre-Renaissance setting.
The absence of vaults will discourage hoarding.

Charge for PC advancement.

==========

PCs:

Perhaps make the composing of a background story/"character essay" an optional endeavor that awards experience points.

PCs can spend points to (magically?) learn extra languages, though it should be difficult to find NPC "trainers" who teach them.

==========

NPCs:

Even rudimentary AI is better than none.

Create "lore provider" NPCs designed to dispense knowledge in response to the "ask" command.

Realistically, NPCs should go to bed at night. Certain mobiles should only come out at night.

Ideas for mobiles:
Beastly Fido
Unit Monster and Multibeast
Rabid Dog

==========

COMBAT:

During combat, a PC may manually switch the opponent they attack.
In a combat where there are multiple opponents, a mobile may automatically switch the opponent they attack.

Combat "stances:" defensive, neutral, offensive.

Felinoids and vulpenoids (but not lagomorphs) have retractable claws that can be utilized as an attack.

==========

MAGIC/PSIONICS:

Magic is affected by the phase of the moon.

There is a cool-down period in which another spell cannot be cast.

Some spells can hit more than one mobile.

==========

QUESTIONS:

Can PCs higher henchmen NPCs to fight with them, heal them, and carry their items?

Boats?

Tour duty?

In what cases do PCs remain active after the player's connection drops?

==========

ANDROID APP:

(Player's interface)
Allow players to monitor the progress of a PC who is engaged in a long-running activity while logged off.
You see how far you are there (to a destination, to learning a skill...) and how much longer to go.
Give % finished and how much time remaining.

Display Inkarnate maps?

Players can read help and books?
