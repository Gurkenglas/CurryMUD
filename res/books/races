Consider including "art" as a topic discussed in the entry for some(?) races.
Abstract modern art movement, including somewhat transgressive performance art, possibly censored by the king.
Perhaps a movement originated by outspoken, liberal, vulpenoidean artists who were protesting the imperialism of the Brahnian Empire (primarily disgruntled, activist artists from vulpenoid families who had immigrated to the two vulpenoid islands of Shunfalip-mi). The king threw them in jail, but the art movement inspired liberal human artists in Wyning to start their own movement exploring abstract art, particularly in painting.
