\h COINS \d

Coins are the currency of CurryMUD. There are "cp" (copper pieces), "sp" (silver pieces), and "gp" (gold pieces).

The following chart illustrates the value of each coin type:

     | cp   | sp   | gp
-------------------------
1 cp | 1    | 1/10 | 1/100
1 sp | 10   | 1    | 1/10
1 gp | 100  | 10   | 1

These identifiers may be used to target coins in commands:
"cp", "sp", "gp", "coins"
"coin" is equivalent to "coins". The other identifiers may not be abbreviated.

The following examples illustrate how to use the coin identifiers with the "get" command:
\qget cp\d to pick up a single copper piece.2`
\qget \p10#m\qcp\d to pick up 10 copper pieces.2`
\qget \p#a\qcp\d to pick up all the copper pieces.2`
\qget \p50#m\qcoins\d to pick up the first 50 coins, beginning with the coins of least value.2`
\qget \p#a\qcoins\d to pick up all the coins.2`
