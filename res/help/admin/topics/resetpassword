\h RESETTING A PASSWORD \d

When you are asked by a player to reset their password, the following procedure should be followed:

1) Has the player provided an email address? (That is, did they select the security question, "What is your email address?") If so, reset their password, and email the new password to the address provided.3`
   (Use the "#dsecurity" command to view a player's security Q&A. Security Q&A are listed in chronological order: the last Q&A listed is the player's most recent setting.)

2) Has the player provided an answer to another security question? If so, ask them their security question.3`

3) If the player has not provided a security Q&A, you may attempt to prove that the person really is who they claim to be by the following means:3`
 * Has the player ever changed their password? Can they recall a previous password?3`
   When a player changes their password, their old password (hashed) is recorded in their log file (search for "password changed"). Use the "#dhash" command to compare the old password (provided by the player) with the hashed old password (obtained from the player's log).
 * Can the player verify an IP address from which they have connected in the past? Can they confirm when they last logged in?3`
   (Use the "#dhost" command to see relevant connection statistics).

4) After furnishing the player with their new password, encourage them to change it immediately.3`
