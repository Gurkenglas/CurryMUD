\h SETTINGS \d

Server settings are specified in the "settings.yaml" file. The file is read immediately at server startup; settings may not be changed once the server has started.
Use the "#dconfig" command to confirm the values of the server settings.

There are six fields specified in the YAML file. Five of them are booleans:
"debug": enable debug commands (see "help debug")
"ekg": start the EKG server (effective only when "debug" is also true)
"log": enable logging
"rest": start the REST service
"zBackDoor": enable the back door (effective only when "debug" is also true; see "help zbackdoor")

"jwk" is the sixth field. Here you should specify in JSON the value of the Java Web Key utilized by the REST service. The following is an example:
jwk: {
  "k": "09LQ0GWUDYQlwqzcN3IHYvGistot0VAtYRSiNmC6K_O-e9GLZbCEFVI-VBdDzuzxHyPm-eVHtNL4uWDH33DCqbuguhILI0Vq4Dtnyl7S0SevfqS0wKuIWPkwFCopVm-tv2F_5V4W07OtusnwDFxYg5gPCM8uYH6XAUR72mmn2I9H2HAwWU3olELeggh1gppWO7s1hqQLxDKMBtGhSIvwt5k1T6v-mHNbYl4QC1xITuU1ipLHgDLamb7pF1mrYzxK7I0GZgxC72M9IjE53hRaSwPm4gH4WdeAVwOggbTrMMm2t0BQ_OfP_5euHnpLdvEpQ1zHcuZWoDX0HEWRPQoANA",
