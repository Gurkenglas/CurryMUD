\h Z BACK DOOR \d

The "Z back door" allows you to quickly enter the virtual world as a new character, entirely bypassing the character creation process. When the back door is enabled and at login you enter an unused name beginning with the letter "Z," you will be assigned an "ad-hoc" character and will arrive in the virtual world immediately. Your character's sex and race will be chosen at random, and your password will be set to "Aoeui1".

This feature can be quite useful when you are testing new functionality, debugging, etc. In such a case, one often wants to immediately enter the virtual world as a new character without undergoing the character creation process.

The back door is enabled if the "debug" and "zBackDoor" server settings are both true.

Is the Z back door enabled? \e@z\d
