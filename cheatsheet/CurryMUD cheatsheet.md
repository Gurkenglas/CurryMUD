# CurryMUD Cheatsheet

Example command output assumes your character's name is Hanako.

## Abbreviation

Nearly all identifiers in CurryMUD may be abbreviated. This means that in many
cases you need not type the entire name of an item, a character, a command, or
a help article.

## Random Names

In channel communications, randomly chosen nouns identify characters with whom you have not established a telepathic link. These "random names" are easily distinguished by the fact that they always start with a lowercase letter and appear underlined. See `help randomnames` for more info.

## Room Fixtures

A "room fixture" is a permanent feature of a room (such as a sign) with which
you can interact via one or more commands. **You may not abbreviate the name of a room fixture, and you may need to tack on the `r-` prefix to indicate that you are targeting an object in your current room.**

## Undocumented Commands

There do exist commands for which there is no help available via the `help` and `?` commands. Typically, undocumented commands may only be used in certain rooms. One example is the `trash` command, which only works when you are in a room with a trash bin. **The names of undocumented commands may not be abbreviated.**
