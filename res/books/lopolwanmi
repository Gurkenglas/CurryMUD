\uLocation\n
@l@lLopo Lwan-mi is an island of the Shunfalip-mi archipelago, located north of Shonlip-mi and south of Zunbun-mi. It is the second of the five islands in the chain when viewed from south to north.

\uHistory\n
@l@lFrom antiquity, Lopo Lwan-mi has been home to a number of autonomous nymphian tribes. The Ashop'ko-zu, Fijalwo-zu, Lwaenmi-zu, and Nmily-zu tribes appear to have lived on the island from the beginning. Each tribe maintained its own territory, and for thousands of years the tribes were able to coexist on friendly and cooperative terms (the same cannot always be said of the nymphs indigenous to the other islands of Shunfalip-mi).

origin of the name of the island

traditionally hunter-gatherer / present-day agriculture?

TODO: The nymphs live in the forest outside of Lop'len-ko. They build their residences above ground and in the trees.
