\h #dMESSAGE \d

\uUSAGE\n
#dmessage name message

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Send a message to a regular player.
If the recipient is currently logged in, the message will be delivered immediately. If the recipient is logged out, the message will be retained (the recipient will see it the next time he/she logs in).

\uEMOTES\n
You can send an emote in a message. Emotes must begin with a \l#x\d. As with the "emote" command, you may optionally specify where your name should appear using \l#e\d. For example, if you type \q#dmessage hanako \l#x\qgives you his full attention\d, Hanako's player will see the following (assuming your name is Taro):
__Taro__ [Taro gives you his full attention.]

Notice how in the above example we have \l#x\qgives you\d, as opposed to \l#x\qgives \l#r\qhanako\d. It is legal to use forms of the word "you" in emotes here and, as there is only one possible target, there is no need for "#rhanako".

\uEXPRESSIVE COMMANDS\n
You can send an expressive command in a message. Expressive commands must begin with a \l#p\d. For example, if you type \q#dmessage hanako \l#p\qcomfort\d, Hanako's player will see the following (assuming your name is Taro):
__Taro__ <Taro comforts you.>

Notice how in the above example we have just \l#p\qcomfort\d, as opposed to \l#p\qcomfort hanako\d. Although the "comfort" expressive command requires a target, in this case it may be omitted.

\uEXAMPLES\n
