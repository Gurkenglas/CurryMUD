A modern history of Rumia: time line

(The current year is about 4170.)

The lagomorphs annex Shunfalip-mi; the entire archipelago becomes part of Falyncentie.

Felinoid Prince Oleverost leads a fleet of twelve boats on a diplomatic trade mission to Belsula. Ten boats, including that carrying the prince, vanish in the Rasen Vortex; the remaining two boats return to Cloessess unscathed.

The Wyning Civil War.
The humans overthrow the monarchy of King Eston and forge a democratic government seated in Kilagore.

The Crimson War.
The vulpenoids under King Brahn III invade Melarue. King Elendar I is overthrown and Melarue becomes a colony of Dolgu, establishing the Brahnian Empire.

The umr epidemic ravages Yurthor.

The Vulpo-Lago War.
The vulpenoids under King Brahn IV invade Shunfalip-mi. A stalemate is reached following the Battle of Zunbun-mi. The vulpenoids colonize Lopo Lwan-mi and Shonlip-mi, while the lagomorphs retain Zunbun-mi, Kap'lwen-mi, and Unlenbi-mi.

In response to the threat of vulpenoidean imperialism, the humans, hobbits, and felinoids ratify the Treaty of Istin, establishing the League of Kingdoms.

The Decade of Quakes. Devastating earthquakes occur throughout Dolgu, Shunfalip-mi, and Falyncentie.
