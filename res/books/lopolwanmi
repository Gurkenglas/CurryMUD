\uLocation\n
@l@lLopo Lwan-mi is an island in the Shunfalip-mi archipelago, located north of Shonlip-mi and south of Zunbun-mi. It is the second of the five islands in the chain when viewed from south to north.

\uHistory\n
@l@lFrom antiquity, Lopo Lwan-mi has been home to four autonomous nymphian tribes: the Ashop'ko-zu, Fijalwo-zu, Lwaenmi-zu, and Nmily-zu. For thousands of years the tribes have been able to coexist on what are, for the most part, friendly and cooperative terms (the same cannot always be said of the nymphs indigenous to the other islands of Shunfalip-mi).
@l@lThe nymphs were traditionally a society of hunter-gatherers. Devout worshipers of Rumialys, they lived off the land.

"Lopo Lwan-mi" means "Big Gorhna Island" in naelyni. The nymphs gave this name to the island for the shape of its coast, which roughly resembles that of the soft gorhna nut.

\uGeogrpahy\n
TODO: Names for geographic features need to be added to the map: Onkunmu Lym, Ship'kalwa-ji.
@l@lLopo Lwan-mi can be roughly divided into three geographic zones. The southern zone is lush, with three major forests and two rugged, hilly regions. The central zone is a tropical savanna featuring great expanses of grassland. The northern zone is a rocky desert.
@l@lLopo Lwan-mi is home to two great mountain ranges. The Kap'kozun-bi is found in the southern zone, while the Onjo-bi extends throughout both the central and northern zones. Notably, there does exist a sufficient pass between the two mountain ranges; this pass, know as Onkunmu Lym in naelyni ("Onkunmu Pass"), is effectively a bridge connecting the western and eastern halves of the island.
@l@lThe Sofun Kanki ("Uninhabited Zone") is a wide stretch of land encompassing the entire northeastern side of the island, from the desert east of the Onjo-bi mountains to the Ship'kalwa-ji river. As the name suggests, this area remains entirely unsettled by bipeds. It is, however, widely known for its great variety of wildlife, not the least of which is the giant honey badger. The grave danger posed by this vicious beast is the primary reason that the Sofun Kanki remains uninhabited to this day.
@l@lThe island has just two freshwater lakes of significant size: Bunlwen-to in the southern zone, and Iali-to in the central zone, near the desert to the north. Iali-to ("Untouched Lake") lies in the Sofun Kanki, far from any bipedal settlements.

\uFauna and flora\n
@l@l
It's common to find gorhna nut trees in the forrests of Lopo Lwan-mi. The fruit of the gorhna nut tree is a large, oft mishapen capsule with a hard, woody shell. It is this fruit that contains the well-known gorhna nuts. The nuts are distinguished not for their taste (which isn't particularly pleasant), but their nutritional value. Soldiers commonly carry them onto the battlefield, and doctors occassionally dispense them to patients.

\uEconomy\n
@l@l
Gorhna nuts are the chief export of Lopo Lwan-mi. Throughout the third millennium, the nymphs traded them directly with all the kingdoms surrounding Shunfalip-mi.

The elves live in the forest outside of Lop'len-ko. They build their residences above ground and in the trees.
