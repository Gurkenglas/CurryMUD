Vulpenoids (young men) born in Dolgu are subjected to mandatory conscription into the Imperial Army for 5(?) years.
Vulpenoid young men born in the colonies ("second generation?") are exceptions to the rule. The emperor explicitly designed this loophole to encourage young adults to immigrate to the colonies and establish families there.
