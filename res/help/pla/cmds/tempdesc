\h TEMPDESC \d

\uUSAGE\n
!tempdesc \s[\ddescription\s]\d

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Specify a "temporary character description" visible when someone looks at you.

For example, let's say you set your temporary description to "his hair is disheveled and his eyes are bloodshot". Now when someone else in your current room looks at you, he or she will see the following (assuming you are a male vulpenoid):

You see a male vulpenoid.
... (Your character's customary description here.)
\m[ \dHis hair is disheveled and his eyes are bloodshot. \m]\d
The male vulpenoid has readied the following equipment:
...

\uNOTES\n
When no arguments are provided to the "tempdesc" command, your temporary description will be cleared.

Note that if it is set, both \qlookself\d and \qstats\d will display your temporary description.

\uRULES\n
@r @v
1) One's temporary description is meant to be just that: an supplementary depiction of transitory, visible characteristics of your character's person. Keep your descriptions realistic and reasonable.3`
2) Descriptions must be passive and written from an objective viewpoint. "he is sweating profusely" is acceptable, while "you are surprised at how sweaty he is" is not.3`
3) Descriptions of where your character is or what your character is actively doing in your current room ("sitting at a table by herself") are better expressed via the "roomdesc" command.3`

\uEXAMPLES\n
\qtempdesc her face portrays a persistent downtrodden expression\d to change your temporary description.4`
\qtempdesc\d to clear your temporary description.4`
