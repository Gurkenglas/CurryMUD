\h SETTINGS \d

Server settings are specified in the "settings.yaml" file. The file is read immediately at server startup; settings may not be changed once the server has started.

The following boolean settings exist:
"debug": enable debug commands (see "help debug")
"ekg": start the EKG server (effective only when "debug" is also true)
"log": enable logging
"rest": start the REST service
"zBackDoor": enable the back door (effective only when "debug" is also true; see "help zbackdoor")
