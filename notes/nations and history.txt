A modern history of Rumia: timeline
(The current year is about 4170.)

The last 200 years have seen a massive increase in international trade. Following a long period of relative peace throughout most of Rumia, three distinct wars broke out, leading to the establishment of Rumia's sole democratic government in Wyning, and the rise of the Brahnian Empire in the East.

3998-4001 (3 years)
The Wyning Civil War.
The humans overthrow the monarchy of King Eston and forge a democratic government seated in Kilagore.

4008
The Lago-Nymphian war.
The lagomorphs annex Shunfalip-mi; the entire archipelago becomes part of Falyncentie.

4071
Felinoid Prince Oleverost leads a fleet of twelve boats on a diplomatic trade mission to Belsula. Ten boats, including that carrying the prince, vanish in the Rasen Vortex; the remaining two boats return to Cloessess unscathed.

4091-4100 (10 years)
The Crimson War.
The vulpenoids under King Brahn III invade Melarue. King Elendar I is overthrown and Melarue becomes a colony of Dolgu, establishing the Brahnian Empire.

4109
The Vulpo-Lago War.
The vulpenoids under King Brahn IV invade Shunfalip-mi. A stalemate is reached following the Battle of Zunbun-mi. The vulpenoids colonize Lopo Lwan-mi and Shonlip-mi, while the lagomorphs retain Zunbun-mi, Kap'lwen-mi, and Unlenbi-mi.

4110
In response to the threat of vulpenoidean imperialism, the humans, hobbits, and felinoids ratify the Treaty of Istin, establishing the League of Kingdoms.

4139-4152 (13 years)
The Umr Epidemic ravages Yurthor.

4150-4160 (10 years)
The Decade of Quakes. Devastating earthquakes occur throughout Dolgu, Shunfalip-mi, and Falyncentie.

Shunfalip-mi

Overview:
Shunfalip-mi is an archipelago between Falyncentie (to the north) and Dolgu (to the south). It marks the divide between the Dopgol Ocean (to the west) and the Orthen Ocean (to the east). Its five islands, from southernmost to northernmost, are: Shonlip-mi, Lopo Lwan-mi, Zunbun-mi, Kap'lwen-mi, and Unlenbi-mi. Zunbun-mi is the largest island, while Unlenbi-mi is the smallest.

History:

Demographics:
Shunfalip-mi is the indigenous home of the nymphs.
Various historical factors have lead to Shunfalip-mi becoming the most racially diverse territory of Rumia by far. Lagomorphs migrated to Shunfalip-mi following the Lago-Nymphian war of 4008. Many elves immigrated to Shunfalip-mi during the Crimson War, as did the vulpenoids following the conclusion of the Vulpo-Lago War of 4109. Some dwarves fled Yurthor for Shunfalip-mi in an attempt to escape the Umr Epidemic. To a lesser extent, increased international trade has lead to a presence of other races as well.

The demographic breakdown of present-day Shunfalip-mi is estimated to be as follows:
45% nymphs
20% lagomorphs
15% vulpenoids
10% elves
5%  dwarves
2%  humans
2%  felinoids
1%  hobbits
