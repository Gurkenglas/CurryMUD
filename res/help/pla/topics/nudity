\h NUDITY \d

If your character has no articles of clothing among his/her readied equipment, then he/she is effectively nude.
This goes for the anthropomorphic races as well (felinoids, lagomorphs, and vulpenoids). That is to say, your character's fur does not adequately conceal his/her private parts.
