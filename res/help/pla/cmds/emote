\h EMOTE \d

\uUSAGE\n
!emote description

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Freely describe an action such that others in your current room will see your description.

By default, your character's name (or a corresponding noun such as "The female human") will be prefixed to the description you provide. Optionally, you may specify where your character's name should appear using \l#e\d. \l#e's\d will create a possessive noun.

Your action may target one or more people in your current room. To specify a target, use \l#r\d, as in \l#r\qmnymph\d. \l#r\qmnymph\l's\d will create a possessive noun.

\uRULES\n
@r @v
1) Your emotes must not implicate the actions of others. "Hanako laughs at Taro, who falls when she trips him" is illegal, as Taro didn't consent to falling down.3`
2) Your emotes may describe interactions with static objects in your room, within reason. "The chair creaks as Hanako sits down" is acceptable, while "Hanako sets the chair on fire" is not, for reasons that should be obvious.3`
3) Your emotes must describe observable actions or states. Emotes such as "Hanako is afraid she lost her ring" violate this rule. (Instead, perhaps emote, "Hanako looks concerned as she fidgets with her bracelet," then say, "I'm afraid I lost my ring...")3`
