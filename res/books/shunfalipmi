\uGeography\n
@l@lShunfalip-mi is an archipelago between Falyncentie to the north and Dolgu to the south. It marks the divide between the Dopgol Ocean to the west and the Orthen Ocean to the east. Its five islands, from southernmost to northernmost, are: Shonlip-mi, Lopo Lwan-mi, Zunbun-mi, Kap'lwen-mi, and Unlenbi-mi. Zunbun-mi is the largest island, while Unlenbi-mi is the smallest.

\uHistory\n
@l@lShunfalip-mi is the indigenous home of the nymphs. With little interference from the outside world, the nymphs maintained their hunter-gatherer culture for nearly 4,000 years in relative peace. Nymphian society organized into at least a dozen autonomous tribes, and a single, central government was never established on the archipelago.
@l@lDuring the third millennium, an increase in trade between the kingdoms to the north and south lead to the creation of a formal trade route along the island chain. Interest in the agricultural products of Shunfalip-mi increased, and many nymphian tribes experienced greater prosperity as a result of engaging in international trade.
@l@lThe Lago-Nymphian war broke out in 4008. Desiring to exercise greater control over the trade route and to absorb/monopolize the market for goods from Shunfalip-mi, the lagomorphean army launched an invasion from Falyncentie with the goal of annexing the archipelago. The nymphs were highly hindered by a lack of inter-tribal organization, and the lagomorphs were victorious in a matter of months. There were relatively few casualties on either side. Shunfalip-mi officially became part of Falyncentie, and the nymphs likewise became citizens of the lagomorphean kingdom; tribal law was superseded by lagomorphean law. Lagomorphs gradually began to migrate to the islands.
@l@lDuring the long and bloody Crimson War between the vulpenoids and elves (4091-4100), the lagomorphs, having long been allies of the elves, made a limited effort to support them militarily. Thousands of elven refugees immigrated to Shunfalip-mi, fleeing violence and persecution. Sympathetic to their plight, the lagomorphs made an earnest attempt to accommodate the refugees.

the Vulpo-Lago War of 4109

Some dwarves fled Yurthor for Shunfalip-mi to escape the Umr Epidemic.

\uDemographics\n
@l@lAlong with increased international trade, various historical factors (highlighted above) have lead to Shunfalip-mi becoming the most racially diverse territory of Rumia. The demographic breakdown of present-day Shunfalip-mi is estimated to be as follows:
45% nymphs
20% lagomorphs
15% vulpenoids
10% elves
5%  dwarves
2%  humans
2%  felinoids
1%  hobbits

\uLanguage\n
@l@lGiven that Shunfalip-mi is racially diverse, it's hardly surprising that many languages are spoken on the islands, and the common tongue is frequently utilized.
@l@lThe vast majority of names given to geological features and settlements come from the naelyni language of the nymphs. Those with a linguistic curiosity will be interested in the meaning of the suffixes that regularly appear in these names. Here are the most common:
"-bi" mountain range
"-ji" river
"-ko" village/settlement
"-mi" island
"-no" forest
"-to" lake

\uEnvironment\n
@l@lMountain ranges can be found throughout the entire archipelago. A rocky desert zone exists at the geographic center of Shunfalip-mi: Zunbun-mi, the middle island, is almost entirely desert. The southern half of Kap'lwen-mi (north of Zunbun-mi) and the northern tip of Lopo Lwan-mi (south of Zunbun-mi) also feature deserts. The regions to the north and south of the central desert zone consist of tropical savannas. Open and continuous grasslands with scattered trees and shrubs are common, with forests often appearing along rivers and wetlands.

\uClimate\n
@l@lThe climate is typically hot, sunny, dry, and somewhat windy all year long. The desert zone is extremely arid and often sweltering, while the climate of the savannas is less extreme. There is a long dry season, and a short wet season during the summer months of Fete Lun and Sun Lun. Rainfall can be unreliable and erratic.

\uFauna and flora\n
@l@lShunfalip-mi is home to a wide variety of plants and animals. Plants adapt at storing water are common, including trees, palms, succulents such as cacti, and spiny shrubs. Native animals include antelope, goats, camels, cheetah, lions, lizards, snakes, scorpions, foxes, jackals, rock cavies, and honey badgers. Highly aggressive giant honey badgers exist in some areas (most notably the Uninhabited Zone of Lopo Lwan-mi).

\uEconomy\n
@l@lShunfalip-mi's major exports include nuts (in particular, gorhna nuts), beans, yams, and spices.
