\uLocation\n
@l@lLopo Lwan-mi is an island of the Shunfalip-mi archipelago, located north of Shonlip-mi and south of Zunbun-mi. It is the second of the five islands in the chain when viewed from south to north.

\uHistory\n
@l@lFrom antiquity, Lopo Lwan-mi has been home to four autonomous nymphian tribes: the Ashop'ko-zu, Fijalwo-zu, Lwaenmi-zu, and Nmily-zu. For thousands of years the tribes have been able to coexist on what are, for the most part, friendly and cooperative terms (the same cannot always be said of the nymphs indigenous to the other islands of Shunfalip-mi).
@l@lThe nymphs were traditionally a society of hunter-gatherers. Devout worshipers of Rumialys, they lived off the land.

"Lopo Lwan-mi" means "Big Gorhna Island" in naelyni. The nymphs gave this name to the island for the shape of its coast, which roughly resembles that of the soft gorhna nut.

\uFauna and flora\n
@l@l
It's common to find gorhna nut trees in the forrests of Lopo Lwan-mi. The fruit of the gorhna nut tree is a large, oft mishapen capsule with a hard, woody shell. It is this fruit that contains the well-known gorhna nuts. The nuts are distinguished not for their taste (which isn't particularly pleasant), but their nutritional value. Soldiers commonly carry them onto the battlefield, and doctors occassionally dispense them to patients.

\uEconomy\n
@l@l
Gorhna nuts are the chief export of Lopo Lwan-mi. Throughout the third millennium, the nymphs traded them directly with all the kingdoms surrounding Shunfalip-mi.
