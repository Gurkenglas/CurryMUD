\h TELEPATHY \d

\uUSAGE\n
!telepathy name message

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Send a private message to a person with whom you have established a two-way telepathic link.

Telepathic communication must be kept In-Character (IC) at all times.

\uEMOTES\n
You can send an emote in a telepathic message. Emotes must begin with a \l#x\d. For example, if you type \qtelepathy hanako \l#x\qgives you his full attention\d, Hanako's player will see the following (assuming your name is Taro):
[Taro] [Taro gives you his full attention.]

Notice how in the above example we have \l#x\qgives you\d, as opposed to \l#x\qgives \l#r\qhanako\d. It is legal to use forms of the word "you" in emotes here and, as there is only one possible target, there is no need for "#rhanako".

As with the "emote" command, you may optionally specify where your character's name should appear using \l#e\d.

\uEXPRESSIVE COMMANDS\n
You can send an expressive command in a telepathic message. Expressive commands must begin with a \l#p\d. For example, if you type \qtelepathy hanako \l#p\qcomfort\d, Hanako's player will see the following (assuming your name is Taro):
[Taro] <Taro comforts you.>

Notice how in the above example we have just \l#p\qcomfort\d, as opposed to \l#p\qcomfort hanako\d. Although the "comfort" expressive command requires a target, in this case it may be omitted.

The use of emotes and expressive commands in telepathic communication is explained IC as being the telepathic projection of thoughts, feelings, and images.
