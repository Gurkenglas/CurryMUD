\h REWARDS \d

Admins are allowed to modestly reward players for reporting typos and bugs. Do not issue rewards in any other situations.

Use the "#dset" command to reward players. Consider giving a reward of 100-5,000 experience points for typos and bugs.

Admins should never reward players using the "bonus" command.
